Setting up crashplan
====================

When you move to a new machine there is a certain way to set it up so that Crashplan doesn't re-back-up everything.

* In Crashplan, start restoring any data that you can that isn't from an external drive.
* Connect WBD and make sure it goes in the right place.
* Once the data is restored to the right locations, select that you want to Adopt the old machine.
