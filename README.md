# mattb-setup.local - home macbook

Additional setup for my home macbook

- `scripts/symlink_credentials.zsh` - requires Dropbox to be in place and `private.dmg` to have been mounted (which in turn requires you to have access to your passwords)
- `scripts/symlink_notes.zsh` - put notes stored in Dropbox in my standard location so that they can be found by vim
